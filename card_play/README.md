## Card Play

A set of types, methods and functions for manipulating playing cards (common french-suited with or
without jokers). Support for cutting, merging, both human style and fully random ordering shuffles,
measuring shuffle quality (rising sequence based), drawing cards, moving cards in a deck
etc.  Handles card stacks containing more than one deck.
Target user is someone who want to manipulate the deck such as magicians, etc.
rather than users looking for an engine for card games.  The solitaire_cypher was the first
use.
