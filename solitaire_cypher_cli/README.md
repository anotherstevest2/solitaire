## solitaire_cypher

An implementation of the playing card based cypher created by
Bruce Schneier and featured in Neal Stephensonâ€™s "Cryptonomicon".
Encrypts or Decrypts stdin to stdout based on the command line provided passphrase.
Returns error if the passphrase includes any non-letter characters.
Crate solitaire_cypher exists to provide these, and more, functions in a lib.
See: <https://www.schneier.com/academic/solitaire/> and, of course, read Cryptonomicon!
